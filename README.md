# Task-List
This project includes front-end and back-end for an TodoList react app. 

What it contains:
1. Functional Login and Register pages.
2. Responsive TodoList application
3. Admin, Dashboard, Users, TodoItems pages.
4. Functional Firebase authenthication ( well I did not include all firebase files as they do contain sensitive information, but a simple implementation can do the trick )

Cool things to consider:
1. Skeleton loading for all items on all pages
2. Optimistic updates everywhere ( failed requests result in retrieval of data )
3. Infinite query scroll
4. Requests are done using Axios
   
Whats missing?
1. firebase_key.json inside the root of todo_project folder
2. db.sqlite3 (can be generated)
3. .env files. If u want to recreate the project you have to create a virtual environment "/env".
